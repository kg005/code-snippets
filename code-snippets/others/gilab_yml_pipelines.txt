CICD 
- autotag
	- takes branch after merge and updates the tag
	- the tag is full feature tag with metadata
	- semantic versioning
		- major - destroys backward compatibility
		- minor - adds functions
		- fixes - no functional changes

- layering pipelines by including them


- package
	- variables
	### Q ### setting of variables within the package.yml - docker host, cluster name
	- other steps should be added 
		- build package
		- releasy it via pypi to our (future) repository

- set project/general-settings/merge-requests
	 - merge commit with semi-linear history - this will make sure you rebase your branch onto master before you merge it
	 - do not allow squashing history - makes you think about the commit messages


- when setting new projet which will be using the pipeline - 
	- deploy key is neccessary to be set:
		- private part in: project/settings/cicd/varaibles/KEY (and name and email)
		- public part in: project/settings/repository/deploy-keys add public key 
		### Q ### what are other privately/publicly accessible deploy keys?? ####


1. create project within a gitlab group
2. add env variables KEY (private key),NAME, EMAIL
2. add public key project/settings/repository/deploy-keys
3. create .gitlab.ci.yml file in the repository and add there
